/**
 * @Reflection
 *
 * This assignment offered a great deal of insight into how Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
 * operate, and more specifically how to rewire a BST to be self-balancing (e.g., AVL tree).
 *
 * AVL trees are more complex to program than I anticipated. Looking back, I spent more time
 * implementing various functionalities than necessary. If I had better understood the
 * intricacies and implementation functionalities, I would have spent far less time on the
 * project. My weakest area of BST/AVL trees is removal, and I spent a great deal of time
 * researching how it works and should be programmed.
 *
 * Overall, I'm pretty content with my work on the project. However, I'm certain given my
 * inexperience with building AVL trees that there are several aspects that could be
 * improved. For instance, I'm sure there's a more optimal solution to removing the n-th
 * node, but I was unable to find a good way of doing so. Additionally, I was extraordinarily
 * bad at implementing the command line interface for the program. I will have to go back
 * and review how to do command line parsing again.
